# Real-time video style transfer with TensorStream

This example demonstrates how to use TensorStream with [fast-neural-style](https://github.com/pytorch/examples/tree/master/fast_neural_style) model.
Input frames from an RTMP stream are converted to Tensors and passed to a trained PyTorch model so an augmented video is produced. The whole pipeline works in real-time.

## Requirements

* TensorStream and the [dependencies](https://github.com/osai-ai/tensor-stream#dependencies).

## Usage

 - Download saved models:
```
python download_saved_models.py
```
 - Run the example with default parameters:
```
python neural_style.py -w 808 -h 456 
```
>**Note:** on Windows you have to add path to ffmpeg executable file to PATH
 - Run the example with specific input/output video, different model weights and model input resolution:
>**Note:** You can pass **--help** to get list of all available options, their description and default values:

```
python neural_style.py -m </path/to/saved-model.pth> -i </path/to/input-file-or-stream> -o </path/to/output-file-or-stream> -t <sec-to-record> -h <height> -w <width>
```

 - You can stream result video to a local address and open it in VLC or another player:
```
python neural_style.py -i tests/resources/bunny.mp4 -o udp://127.0.0.1:1234 -m ./saved_models/candy.pth -w 808 -h 456
```
for example, you can use MPlayer to view the results:
```
mplayer -demuxer +mpegts -framedrop -benchmark udp://127.0.0.1:1234?buffer_size=1000000
```
